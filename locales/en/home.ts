          "The Cherrier Tango was produced from 1992 to 1996 alongside the Cherrier Picnic, it sold ~30000 units in total being discontinued due to the higher popularity of the Picnic. All the models of the Tango came with either a 1.2L or 1.4L MPFI 4 cylinder engine that produced 64PS/100NM and 89PS/118NM respectively. The Tango had a trendy digital speedometer in the center of the dash and a warning light strip above the steering wheel, which were both very rare features previously exclusive to only luxury cars.",

It used a 4-Cylinder engine and supercharger to show more powerful performance than competing models. There was an Actif model that applied a classic style design that was popular in Japan. It went through a facelift once in 1996, and it was produced until 2002.",
